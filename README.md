RogueChat
=========

A client and server for a roguelike chatroom

If you are killed you must start over with a new name

Setup

1. Check your version of python, I tested with 2.7.3 but it should work with any version of 2.6 or 2.7

2. Open terminal and enter python roguechatclient.py

3. When asked for the host enter 54.209.127.40

Commands

"#enter <roomname>" : Moves you to the room you enter

"#leave" : Returns you to the lobby

"#stab <name>" : Kills the player you enter returning them to the lobby and making them choose a new name

"#quit" : Exits the client returning you to a terminal prompt
